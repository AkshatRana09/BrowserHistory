# 🧭 Browser History Manager (C++ Console Project)

A simple C++ console application that simulates a **browser's back button functionality** using the **Stack** data structure.

## 🚀 Features

- Visit a new webpage (push to history)
- Go back to the previous page (pop from history)
- View the current page (peek the stack)
- Prevents overflow and underflow
- Simple stack-based implementation using arrays

## 📁 Files

- `browser_history.cpp` – Source code
- `README.md` – You're reading it!
